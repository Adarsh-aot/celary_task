# PDF to JSON Data Extraction using Donut Transformer

This project demonstrates how to process PDF files by splitting them into pages, extracting data using a transformer model (Donut Transformer), and saving the extracted data as JSON files in the same directory as the original PDFs.

## Features

- Split PDF files into individual pages (PNG images).
- Extract data from each page using a transformer model (e.g., Donut Transformer).
- Save extracted data in JSON format alongside the original PDF files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-aot/quipo-oscar.git
```
```bash
cd pdf-to-json
```


Install the required Python packages:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run code 

```bash
python main.py
```
